## 1. Interrupts are the bridge between **hardware** and the **operating system**

* Hardware devices (keyboard, disk, network card, etc.) generate interrupts.
* The CPU can’t directly handle these in a meaningful way — it just knows “something happened.”
* The **OS provides the code** (interrupt handlers) that decides **what to do** when an interrupt occurs.


##  2. OS provides **Interrupt Service Routines (ISRs)**

* When an interrupt happens, the CPU jumps to a special memory location that points to an ISR.
* These ISRs are part of the OS code (or drivers inside the OS).
* Example:

  * Keyboard sends interrupt → CPU jumps to keyboard ISR → OS reads the key and puts it into a buffer.

## 3. OS manages the **Interrupt Vector Table (IVT) / IDT**

* The IVT (or IDT in x86) is a table in memory that tells the CPU which piece of OS code (ISR) to execute for each interrupt number.
* The OS sets up this table during boot.
* Example: Interrupt `0x21` might be mapped to "keyboard handler."

##  4. OS uses interrupts for **system calls** (software interrupts)

* When a user program wants to ask the OS for something (like read a file, allocate memory, print text), it can’t directly touch hardware.
* Instead, it triggers a **software interrupt** (or nowadays, special CPU instructions like `syscall`).
* This switches the CPU into **kernel mode** and runs OS code.


##  5. OS uses interrupts for **process scheduling**

* A hardware timer periodically generates an interrupt (say every 10 ms).
* The timer interrupt handler is OS code that decides:

  * “Should I keep running the current process, or switch to another one?”
    → This is how **multitasking** works.

##  Example flow

You press a key:

1. **Hardware (keyboard)** → sends an interrupt signal to CPU.
2. **CPU** → pauses current user program and jumps to OS code (keyboard ISR).
3. **OS code** → reads scanned code from keyboard controller and stores it.
4. OS later delivers this input to the user program.

✅ So in short:

* **Interrupt = signal (event).**
* **OS code = handler (what to do when event happens).**
* Without OS code, interrupts are just raw signals with no meaning.

Do you want me to also show you **how an interrupt handler looks in OS code** (like in C/assembly for Linux/Windows)?
